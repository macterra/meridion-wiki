__Note__: Most of the actions on this page require administrative privileges.
They won't work unless you have set an admin username and password in the PhpWiki config file.

----------
!! Cleanup
A Wiki SandBox is very easy to clean. Here you can restore it to pristine condition by loading the default from pgsrc:

[ Rake the SandBox | phpwiki:?action=loadfile&source=pgsrc/SandBox ].

----------
!! Making Snapshots or Backups

! ZIP files of database

These links lead to zip files, generated on the fly, which contain all
the  pages in your Wiki.  The zip file will be downloaded to your local computer.

This __[ZIP Snapshot | phpwiki:?action=zip]__ contains only the latest versions
of each page, while this __[ZIP Dump | phpwiki:?action=zip&include=all]__ contains all
archived versions.

(If the PhpWiki is configured to allow it,) anyone can download a zip file.

If your php has ''zlib'' support, the files in the archive will be compressed,
otherwise they will just be stored.

! Dump to directory

Here you can dump pages of your Wiki into a directory of your choice.

<?plugin WikiForm action=dumpserial?>

The most recent version of each page will written out to the
directory, one page per file.
Your server must have write permissions to the directory!

-----------
!! Restoring

If you have dumped a set of pages from PhpWiki, you can reload them here.
Note that pages in your database will be overwritten; thus, if you dumped
your HomePage when you load it from this form it will overwrite the one
in your database now. If you want to be selective just delete
the pages from the directory (or zip file) which you don't want to load.

! Upload File

Here you can upload ZIP archives, or individual files from
your (client) machine.

<?plugin WikiForm action=upload?>

! Load File

Here you can load ZIP archives, individual files or entire directories.
The file or directory must be local to the http server.
You can also use this form to load from an http: or ftp: URL.

<?plugin WikiForm action=loadfile?>

-----------
!! Format of the files

Currently the pages are stored, one per file, as MIME (RFC:2045)
e-mail (RFC:822) messages.
The content-type ''application/x-phpwiki'' is used, and page meta-data
is encoded in the content-type parameters.
(If the file contains several versions of a page, it will have
type ''multipart/mixed'', and contain several sub-parts, each
with type ''application/x-phpwiki''.)
The message body contains the page text.

! Old Formats

__Serialized Files__

The dump to directory command used to dump the pages as
php ''serialized()'' strings.  For humans, this made the files very hard
to read, and nearly impossible to edit.

__Plain Files__

Before that the page text was just dumped to a file--this means
that all page meta-data was lost. Note that when loading
''plain files'', the page name is deduced from the file name.

The upload and load functions will automatically recognize each of these
three types of files, and handle them accordingly.
----
!! Dump pages as XHTML
<?plugin WikiForm action=dumphtml?>

This will generate a directory of static pages suitable for distribution on disk where no web server is available.
